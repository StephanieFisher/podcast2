           <h2>S-town</h2>
           
           <h3>Structure</h3>
           
                <p>This podcast is structured like a murder mystery mixed with a radio story.</p>
           
           <h3>Who does the talking?</h3>
           
                <p>The reporter does most of the talking, but there are many interviews with the townsfolk as well.</p>
           
           <h3>Is it scripted?</h3>
           
                <p>Yes, insofar as the show was written and acted out by voice actors.</p>
           
           <h3>Interviews?</h3>
           
                <p>This show was basically based around interviews, with a good amount of foley mixed in.</p>
           
           <h3>Are there sound effects and music?</h3>
           
                <p>There are many sound effects during the interviews that give the impression that they were recorded on location, ie; gravel crunching underfoot; the sharpening of a chainsaw; wind whipping around, ect, ect.</p>
           
           <h2>Serial</h2>
           
           <h3>Structure</h3>
           
                <p>Much like S-town (as it seems to be by the same people), this podcast is set up as a murder mystery investigation drama.</p>
        
          <h3>Who is talking?</h3>
           
                <p>The narrator does the vast majority of the speaking, with voice clips from some of the characters chiming in when appropriate.</p>
          
          <h3>Is it scripted?</h3>
           
                <p>Yes, but like the previous podcast, it is set up like a real investigation.</p>
           
           <h3>Interviews?</h3>
           
                <p>There are only voice clips from the interviewed, no questions are being asked in the clips themselves.</p>
           
           <h3>Are there sound effects and music?</h3>
           
                <p>There is some music to set the mood.</p>
